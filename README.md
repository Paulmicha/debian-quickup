Collection of Shell / Bash Setup Scripts
========================================

**Mostly just for apt-get / aptitude based distributions (Debian, Ubuntu)**

These are meant for quickly setting up local dev environments (typically VirtualBox VMs), when there's no Vagrant / Docker / Ansible / Puppet / Chef / whatever automation (or PaaS / SaaS) available at hand.

Re-organization 2014/11/27 :
- Arbitrary categorization in folders
- Naming convention to differenciate notes for a manual step by step procedure (filename.notes.sh) from actual executable scripts (filename.script.sh) that have been tested at least once successfully in indicated environment.
